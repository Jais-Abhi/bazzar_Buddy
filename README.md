# BazarBuddy

A simple, user-first web app to help Indian street food vendors source raw materials efficiently from trusted and affordable suppliers nearby.

## Problem Statement

Street food vendors in India face difficulties in sourcing quality raw materials at affordable prices from reliable suppliers. There is no structured platform for searching, comparing, and ordering ingredients with trust and transparency.

## Solution

BazarBuddy is a minimal, role-based web app that connects street vendors (buyers) and suppliers (sellers):

- Vendors can search and browse verified local suppliers, compare prices, place orders, track their deliveries, and receive notifications.
- Suppliers can manage their product catalogs, view/manage orders, track notifications, and maintain profiles/ratings.

The app focuses on simplicity and speed, using React.js with React Router and Tailwind CSS (CDN) for fast UI development.
